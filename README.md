# Anagram Organiser

# Question tackled:
- Your program should run on the command line and take one argument which is a filename that contains a large list of words separated by new lines. For example `this_is_my_program this_is_my_data_file.txt`.

- This file should be re-organized so that the words that are anagrams of each other are all on one line separated by spaces.

# Outcome:
- Wrote a script that reorganizes a text file containing a list of words such that words that are anagrams of each other are grouped together on the same line, separated by spaces.
- By running this script in the command line, the txt file updates; showing the anagrams on the same line.
- The txt file re-organises by running the script python main.py list_of_words.txt

# Features 
- Reads a list of words from a specified text file.
- Identifies anagrams within the list.
- Groups anagrams together on the same line in the output.
- Writes the reorganized list back to the original text file.

# Technologies used
- Python
